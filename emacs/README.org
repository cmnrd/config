* What is this?

This is my personal emacs configuration. I am new to emacs so this config is
far from perfect. However, maybe you find something useful in here.

* Usage

You can simply copy (or link) all the files to your ~\~/.emacs.d~ directory.
However, my preferred solution is to copy ~emac.el~ and then edit the path for
loading ~load-directory~ and ~config.d~ to the location of this repository. To
apply some local configurations, you can add a file ~local.el~ tto your
~\~/.emacs.d~ directory.
